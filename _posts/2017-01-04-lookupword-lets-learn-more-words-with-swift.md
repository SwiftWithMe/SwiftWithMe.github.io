## A project with server side and client side application



### Preparation

> 1. [Vapor](http://vapor.university/) - A server side Swift framework
2. [owlbot dictionary](https://owlbot.info/api/v1/dictionary/owl) - A dictionary API
3. [Applescript](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/121790/is-there-a-way-to-track-my-look-ups-in-the-osx-dictionary/121802#121802) to record the new vocabulary which I looked up
4. A iOS client side for browsing new vocabulary
5. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - A place to deploy our application and database
6. [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/xcode/id497799835?l=zh&mt=12) - Where we develop both server side and client side application


### Objectives

I want to record every word I look up from my MacBook, moreover, I want to review it later for practice. The build-in function of the dictionary is nice, I've use the three-tap(and also [other ways](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-5-ways-to-grab-a-definition-in-os-x--mac-31062)) for look up a word which I'm not sure the meaning. However, it didn't log what I've searched, and I keen to find my own way to do this.

So, let's do it by ourself, to accomplish this function, and also, practice the Swift language both server side and client side.

What will you got after following this tutorial:

> 1. A cloud server that save your vocabulary
2. A iOS client to browse your vocabulary
3. A service on MacOS to lookup new word


### Procedure

only three steps:

> 1. Set up vapor server and deploy on the Heroku
2. Write a scrip for look up new word
3. Develop a iOS client to browse vocabulary





The great thing is that it's all **free**.

Sounds nice, huh.

Let's Swift with me.
